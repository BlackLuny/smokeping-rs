# Static Assets MIME Type Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The frontend was failing to load with the error:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

This error occurred because the browser was requesting JavaScript files (like `/assets/index-qciAn6_P.js`) but receiving HTML content instead.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `spa_fallback` function in `src/main.rs`. The function was serving the `index.html` file for ALL non-API routes, including static assets like JavaScript files, CSS files, and images. This meant:

1. Browser requests `/assets/index-qciAn6_P.js` (expecting JavaScript)
2. Server returns `index.html` content with `text/html` MIME type
3. Browser rejects the content because it expected JavaScript with `application/javascript` MIME type

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Static Asset Serving
Modified the `spa_fallback` function to:
1. **First attempt**: Try to serve the requested path as a static asset from embedded files
2. **Set correct MIME type**: Use `mime_guess` to determine the appropriate Content-Type header
3. **Fallback**: Only serve `index.html` for routes that don't match static assets

### 2. Added Dependencies
- Added `mime_guess = "2.0"` to `Cargo.toml` for proper MIME type detection

### 3. Improved Request Handling Flow
```
Request comes in
    ↓
Is it an API route (/api/*)? → Return 404
    ↓
Does it match a static asset? → Serve with correct MIME type
    ↓
Otherwise → Serve index.html (SPA routing)
```

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```rust
async fn spa_fallback(request: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let path = request.uri().path();
    
    if path.starts_with("/api/") {
        return (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "Not Found").into_response();
    }
    
    // This served index.html for EVERYTHING, including JS/CSS files!
    if let Some(content) = Frontend::get("index.html") {
        use axum::response::Html;
        Html(content.data).into_response()
    } else {
        (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "SPA file not found").into_response()
    }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```rust
async fn spa_fallback(request: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let path = request.uri().path();
    
    if path.starts_with("/api/") {
        return (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "Not Found").into_response();
    }
    
    let asset_path = path.strip_prefix('/').unwrap_or(path);
    
    // Try to serve static assets first with correct MIME types
    if let Some(content) = Frontend::get(asset_path) {
        let mime_type = mime_guess::from_path(asset_path).first_or_octet_stream();
        
        return (
            StatusCode::OK,
            [(axum::http::header::CONTENT_TYPE, mime_type.as_ref())],
            content.data,
        ).into_response();
    }
    
    // Only serve index.html for non-asset routes (SPA routing)
    if let Some(content) = Frontend::get("index.html") {
        use axum::response::Html;
        Html(content.data).into_response()
    } else {
        (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "SPA file not found").into_response()
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Correct MIME Types**: Static assets are now served with proper Content-Type headers
   - JavaScript files: `application/javascript`
   - CSS files: `text/css`
   - SVG files: `image/svg+xml`
   - etc.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers enforce strict MIME type checking for module scripts

3. **SPA Routing Preserved**: Non-asset routes still correctly serve the index.html for client-side routing

4. **Performance**: Static assets are served directly without unnecessary HTML parsing

## File Mapping Examples

| Request Path | Response | Content-Type |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| `/assets/index-qciAn6_P.js` | JavaScript file | `application/javascript` |
| `/assets/index-DK3SaXSL.css` | CSS file | `text/css` |
| `/vite.svg` | SVG file | `image/svg+xml` |
| `/dashboard` | index.html | `text/html` |
| `/targets/123` | index.html | `text/html` |
| `/api/targets` | API response or 404 | `application/json` |

## Testing

The fix has been verified by:
1. Successful frontend and backend builds
2. Proper static asset detection and serving
3. Maintained SPA routing functionality
4. Correct MIME type assignment

## Deployment Notes

After deploying this fix:
- The frontend will load correctly without MIME type errors
- Static assets will be served with appropriate Content-Type headers
- SPA routing will continue to work as expected
- API routes remain unaffected
